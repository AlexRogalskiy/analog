# AnaL&oacute;g

AnaLog (pronounced with stressed "*o*") is a tool for convenient real-time displaying of various logs in your browser.
Think of it as of web interface to traditional [tail](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail) utility
with a bunch of improvements:
* log level syntax highlighting
* predefined and on-demand log choice configuration (via YAML or URL correspondingly)
* fetching logs from various sources including remote servers, Docker containers and Kubernetes resources
* ability to combine several separate log sources into one composite log
* automatic formatting and highlighting of XML documents in logs
* downloading currently chosen log fully or partly for further 'offline' processing

## Project Status
AnaLog is personal R&D project and currently it is still in development
and stabilization stage. As a consequence:
1. It is not production-ready yet product but is being prepared to be.
2. Its web UI interface aimed to current testing users audience and
therefore supports their native language only (Russian).

If you have any questions about the product, want to try it or to help
in its development, please feel free to [contact the author](mailto:toparvion@gmx.com) or
[submit an issue](https://github.com/Toparvion/analog/issues/new).
