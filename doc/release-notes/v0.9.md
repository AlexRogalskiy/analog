# v0.9 - Java 9 is here

* Host and ports of cluster properties are now set separately. There are 2 kind of port to specify: 
1. Agent port - a port to use by AnaLog server instance to support remote log monitoring; 
2. Server port - a port to use by user browser and by other servers for downloading log files from agent instances.
By default this port is equal to `server.port` of current AnaLog instance.

* `clusterProperties` param has been renamed to `nodes`
