# v0.9 - Java 9 is here

* Host and ports of cluster properties are now set separately. There are 2 kind of port to specify: 
    1. Agent port - a port to use by AnaLog server instance to support remote log monitoring;   
    2. Server port - a port to use by user browser and by other servers for downloading log files from agent instances.
By default this port is equal to `server.port` of current AnaLog instance.

* `clusterProperties` param has been renamed to `nodes`
* Added `/download` resource to AnaLog's REST API:
    * `HEAD /download` returns content length and last modified timestamp of specified file even if it resides on 
    remote node;
    * `GET /download` returns the specified file itself (as an attachment in order to facilitate streaming 
    downloading). This also works transparently even for files on remote nodes of AnaLog.
