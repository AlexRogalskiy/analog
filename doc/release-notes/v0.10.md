# v0.10 - 'Download current log' feature

* Host and ports of cluster properties are now set separately. There are 2 kind of ports to specify: 
    1. Agent port - a port to use by AnaLog server instance to support remote log monitoring;   
    2. Server port - a port to use by user browser and by other servers for downloading log files from agent 
    instances.  
This port is not required and by default equals to `server.port` of current AnaLog instance.

* `clusterProperties` param has been renamed to `nodes`.
* Added `/download` resource to AnaLog's server HTTP API:
    * `HEAD /download` returns content length and last modified timestamp of specified file even if it resides on 
    remote node;
    * `GET /download` returns the specified file itself (as an attachment in order to facilitate streaming 
    downloading). This also works transparently even for files on remote nodes of AnaLog.
    
    The new resource is designed to be used in various ways:
    * By web client application (in browser) to start file downloading via dedicated button on the control panel;
    * By other servers to retrieve files from agents in previous scenario;
    * By users themselves to download frequently used files (e.g. by making a browser bookmark).
