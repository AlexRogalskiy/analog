NAME
     tail - deliver the last part of a file

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/tail [_s number [lbcr]] [file]


     /usr/bin/tail [-lbcr] [file]


     /usr/bin/tail [_ number [lbcf]] [file]


     /usr/bin/tail [-lbcf] [file]


     /usr/xpg4/bin/tail [-f | -r] [-c number | -n number] [file]


     /usr/xpg4/bin/tail [_ number [l | b | c] [f]] [file]


     /usr/xpg4/bin/tail [_ number [l] [f | r]] [file]


DESCRIPTION
     The tail utility copies the named file to the standard  out-
     put  beginning  at  a designated place. If no file is named,
     the standard input is used.


     Copying begins at a point in the file indicated  by  the  -c
     number,  -n  number,  or  _  number  options (if + number is
     specified, begins at distance number from the beginning;  if
     -  number is specified, from the end of the input; if number
     is NULL, the value 10 is  assumed).  number  is  counted  in
     units of lines or byte according to the -c or -n options, or
     lines, blocks, or bytes, according to the appended option l,
     b, or c. When no units are specified, counting is by lines.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported for  both  /usr/bin/tail
     and  /usr/xpg4/bin/tail.  The -r and -f options are mutually
     exclusive. If both are specified on the command line, the -f
     option is ignored.

     -b    Units of blocks.


     -c    Units of bytes.

     -f    Follow. If the input-file is not a pipe,  the  program
           does  not  terminate  after the line of the input-file
           has been copied, but enters an endless  loop,  wherein
           it  sleeps  for a second and then attempts to read and
           copy further records from the input-file. Thus it  can
           be  used to monitor the growth of a file that is being
           written by some other process.


     -l    Units of lines.


     -r    Reverse. Copies  lines  from  the  specified  starting
           point  in the file in reverse order. The default for r
           is to print the entire file in reverse order.


  /usr/xpg4/bin/tail
     The following options are supported  for  /usr/xpg4/bin/tail
     only:

     -c number    The number option-argument must  be  a  decimal
                  integer  whose sign affects the location in the
                  file, measured in bytes, to begin the copying:

                  +       Copying starts relative to  the  begin-
                          ning of the file.


                  -       Copying starts relative to the  end  of
                          the file.


                  none    Copying starts relative to the  end  of
                          the file.

                  The origin for counting is 1; that  is,  -c  +1
                  represents  the  first  byte of the file, -c -1
                  the last.


     -n number    Equivalent to -c number,  except  the  starting
                  location  in  the  file  is  measured  in lines
                  instead of bytes. The origin for counting is 1.
                  That is, -n +1 represents the first line of the
                  file, -n -1 the last.


OPERANDS
     The following operand is supported:

User Commands                                             tail(1)



     file    A path name of an input file. If  no  file  operands
             are specified, the standard input is used.


USAGE
     See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of tail
     when  encountering  files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (
     2^31 bytes).

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the tail Command


     The following command prints the last ten lines of the  file
     fred,  followed  by  any  lines  that  are  appended to fred
     between the time tail is initiated and killed.


       example% tail -f fred




     The next command prints the last 15 bytes of the file  fred,
     followed  by any lines that are appended to fred between the
     time tail is initiated and killed:


       example% tail -15cf fred



ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment
     variables  that  affect the execution of tail: LANG, LC_ALL,
     LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0     Successful completion.


     >0    An error occurred.


ATTRIBUTES
     See attributes(5) for descriptions of the  following  attri-
     butes:

NOTES
     Piped tails relative to the end of the file are stored in  a
     buffer,  and  thus  are  limited in length. Various kinds of
     anomalous behavior can happen with character special files.
